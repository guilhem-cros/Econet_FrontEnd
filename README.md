# Econet FrontEnd

This is our first Flutter project.
Interface of an Android app, centered on an interactive map.

## Getting Started

1. Make sure you have Flutter and Dart installed. If not, install Flutter and set up your editor.
2. Clone the repository
3. Get the required packages: `flutter pub get`
4. Change the API related constants to yours in `lib/utils/constants.dart`
5. In folder `lib` create a `.env` file containing ```API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY``` with your Google Map API key, see the [Google Doc](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key)
6. Run the app on your device/emulator : `flutter run`

## Note
- The app needs to be linked to the associated BackEnd server to run, see this [repo](https://github.com/guilhem-cros/BackEnd-Econet)
